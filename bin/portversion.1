.Nd a tool to compare the versions of installed packages with the ones in the ports tree

.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is used to produce a report of installed ports/packages.
.Pp
Each package's version number is checked against the corresponding
entry in the ports database to see if a newer version is available for
upgrade.  If a package is not found in the database,
.Nm
inspects the origin port to get the version.
.Pp
.Nm
is very similar to
.Xr pkg_version 1 ,
but is optimized for
.Xr portupgrade 1
and runs much faster than
.Xr pkg_version 1
thanks to the ports database generated from the INDEX file.  See
.Xr portsdb 1
for details.
.Pp
Each package name is printed, along with a one-character status flag:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Li =
The installed version of the package is current.
.It Li \&<
The installed version of the package is older than the current
version.
.It Li \&>
The installed version of the package is newer than the current
version.  This situation can arise with using an out-of-date INDEX
file, or when testing new ports.
.It Li \&?
The installed package does not appear in the database nor does the
port directory exist.  This could be because the port has been removed
from the official ports tree, or because the package was installed
from an unofficial (or not yet committed) port, or because the INDEX
file has not been synchronized (updated) with the ports tree yet.
.It Li \&!
The installed package does not appear in the database, the port
directory actually exists, the port's Makefile is broken and the
latest version number cannot be obtained.
.It Li \&#
The installed package does not have an origin recorded.  This could be
because the package was installed before the concept of
.Sq origin
was introduced.  You can run
.Dq Nm pkgdb -F
to complete missing origins.
.El
.Pp
You can resolve most out-of-date situations by updating the ports tree
and running
.Dq Nm portsdb Fl U .
(See
.Xr portsdb 1
for details)
.Pp
Before reading these instructions, you must understand that a
port/package can have the following two types of related
ports/packages:
.Bl -tag -width "dependent" -compact
.It required
Ports/packages that a port/package needs for it to be built and/or
run.  Port Makefiles refer to this type of ports/packages using the
.Dv BUILD_DEPENDS
and 
.Dv RUN_DEPENDS
macros, respectively.
.It dependent
Ports/packages that need this port/package.
.El
.Sh OPTIONS
The following command line arguments are supported:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "--command-args ARGS" -compact
.It Ar pkgname_glob
Specify one of these: a full pkgname, a pkgname without version, a
shell glob pattern in which you can use wildcards
.Sq * ,
.Sq \&? ,
and
.Sq [..] ,
an extended regular expression preceded by a colon
.Sq \&: ,
or a date range specification preceded by either
.Sq <
or
.Sq > .
See
.Xr pkg_glob 1
for details and concrete examples.
.Pp
If none is specified,
.Nm
checks all the installed packages.
.Pp
In any case, the results will be listed in alphabetical order, not in
dependency order as with other tools.
.Pp
.It Fl h
.It Fl -help
Show help and exit.
.Pp
.It Fl c
.It Fl -command-output
Enable command output.  Command output includes a command of
.Xr portupgrade 1
you should run to upgrade your installed packages to the latest
versions in the ports system.  This feature does not constitute an
automated packages upgrading system.  Edit the list of packages to
upgrade and the options for
.Xr portupgrade 1
and run it to perform the upgrade.
.Pp
.It Fl C Ar ARGS
.It Fl -command-args Ar ARGS
Specify options to pass to
.Xr portupgrade 1
to be used in the command output.
.Pp
.It Fl -ignore-moved
Do not read MOVED file.
.Pp
.It Fl l Ar CHARS
.It Fl -limit Ar CHARS
Only include the packages with the specified status flags.
.Pp
.It Fl L Ar CHARS
.It Fl -inv-limit Ar CHARS
Exclude the packages with the specified status flags.
.Pp
.It Fl O
.It Fl -omit-check
Omit sanity checks for dependencies.  By default,
.Nm
checks whether all packages it is to check have consistent
dependencies, though it takes extra time to calculate dependencies.
If you are sure you have run
.Dq Li "pkgdb -F"
in advance, you can specify this option to omit the sanity checks.
.Pp
.It Fl q
.It Fl -noconfig
Do not read the configuration file. ($PREFIX/etc/pkgtools.conf)
.Pp
.It Fl r
.It Fl -recursive
Check all packages depending on the given packages as well.
.Pp
.It Fl R
.It Fl -upward-recursive
Check all packages required by the given packages as well.
.Pp
.It Fl t
.It Fl -test
Compare the version with the following one(s), and print the result(s).
.Pp
.It Fl v
.It Fl -verbose
Turn on verbose output.
.Pp
.It Fl x Ar GLOB
.It Fl -exclude Ar GLOB
Exclude packages matching the specified glob pattern.  Exclusion is
performed after recursing dependency in response to
.Fl r
and/or
.Fl R ,
which means, for example, the following command will check for all the
packages depending on XFree86 but not for XFree86:
.Pp
.Nm portupgrade
.Fl rx
.Ar XFree86 XFree86
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width "PKGTOOLS_CONF" -compact
.It Ev PKG_DBDIR
Alternative location for the installed package database.  The default
is
.Dq Pa /var/db/pkg .
.Pp
.It Ev PORTSDIR
Alternative location for the ports tree and the ports database files.
The default is
.Dq Pa /usr/ports .
.Pp
.It Ev PKGTOOLS_CONF
Configuration file for the pkgtools suite.  The default is
.Dq Pa $PREFIX/etc/pkgtools.conf .
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width "$PREFIX/etc/pkgtools.conf"
.It Pa /var/db/pkg
Default location of the installed package database.
.It Pa /usr/ports
Default location of the ports tree and the ports database files.
